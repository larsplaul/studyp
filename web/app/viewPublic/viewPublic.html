    <h2>What are Study Points?</h2>
    <p>On the Computer Science AP education (datamatiker) we use a system of study points, earned by participating in areas necessary to become a great student.</p>
    <p>Students earn study points for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attending and participating in class</li>
      <li>Individual exercises, necessary to improve personal skills</li>
      <li>Group based projects, necessary to improve group and personal skills</li>
      <li>Helping other Students</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Generally Study Points is rewarded for a determined effort, in most cases not for the actual result</p>

    <h2>What Study Points Are Not</h2>
    <p>Study Points are <b>NOT</b> grades.</p>
    <p>As a student you can attend and participate in the class, work on individual exercises, group projects and help others, even if you donâ€™t belong to "the top" of the class.</p>
    <p>We believe however, that doing all these things, eventually will lead to better grades, and more important better students.</p>
